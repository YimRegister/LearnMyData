# Learn My Data

Here is the website that hosts the linear regression tutorial. This tutorial has 2 conditions, and plenty of problems.

It is a beginning prototype for how we might teach linear regression using the user's own input and their own data. It i a guided tour through your own personally provided data with prompts to think about and demonstrations of gradient descent.

## Personal Condition
This includes an input table in JS that the user will input their own information. Nothing is automatically curated, and the current problem involves subjective Likert-scale judgments on their own "interest level" in a class they are taking. In addition to interest level, they report the grade they received in that class. These can be plotted on a 2D scatter plot and used to teach linear regression. The data is input into the table, and that becomes the data for the remainder of the tutorial.

## Impersonal Condition
This condition does not include an input table, and does not use language that speaks about the user as an agent of this tutorial. Instead, a hypothetical student is introduced, with hypothetical data, and that data is used for the tutorial. Everything else is the same between Impersonal and Personal conditions.

### Facebook Version
There is also a version where users can look at their scatter plot of Facebook Likes to Comments on their own profiles, collecting manually for now.

## Facts Condition
There is also a condition where a list of heuristic facts are listed simply, in a PSA kind of format for the user. The purpose of that condition is bare-minimum control.

## Critique
Following the tutorial are critiques of models in the world, in addition to several measures on how generative and thoughtful the user is after a given condition intervention.
