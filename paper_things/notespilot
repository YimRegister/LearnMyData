pilot notes/user testing

drag and drop line, or add animation
reset button doesn't work
add class name and add for labels

add a break
add more in about critiquing in the tutorial

_____________________________________________________________________________________
1-7? 1 is most interested or least interested?
"should i use a real course or made up" REAL! don't be so nice, Yim
"should I use the real course name?" No, it's just a label for you!
"for every increase in one interest, there is ".2" or whatever increase in grade
"showing a not normal value actually helps you think"
"buttons should disappear at the end " DONE
"I didn't know I had to start with linear regression to learn machine learning. That there could be patterns of data to predict the future. There's so many different scenarios, I don't know if one model could fit them all but..."
"so many of my capstone friends did their projects with city of seattle" (relating to personal data)
* add follow up interview or question: what was it like using your own personal data?


//what are the exact course names (you don't need the actual codes!)
question with no options, either say that it's rhetorical or have something to fill in the answer
"I'm looking back on my data and I've done really well in courses where I've rated more than 5"
"An interest rating of 4 is 'should I even wake up and go to class?'"
"I actually haven't heard of line of best fit"
"No, my data doesn't fall in one line"
"I wanted to drag the line and I couldn't"
"someone might not know y=mx+b"
"so linear regression is just about finding a line? for some points?"
"I'll skip them because that's what I do when I know something, I skip it"
"zero messed it up"
"what's the scale for filling it in?"
"where is the new point"?
"we could predict for more standardized stuff where we know how it's made"

"I dont know anything about construction so I have less to say and less to critique. doing things fast is not necessarily a good thing."

*** issues with how it grabs course name***
**** program in reset button and dragging the line!****
