Notes for Experimenter:
Subj 1

*Which data science courses did you take? (add to opening question)
*"I want to learn more about this data" get rid of "other things like it"

* People want resources, please provide card or email with links
Need interface for social media data input!! It's awkward!
She asked about my particular journey into ML, and showed a lot of interest in the Coursera course or any resources available

Subj 2
* what will make it more comfortable for me and participant?
* Maybe I won't gain very much from the comments/questions/line number stuff because people might not write at all
* moves through tutorial really quickly?
"If I go to twitter can I use other stuff because I don't post a lot of my own stuff" --> meaning my tool would really have to automatically generate data from what they post about, even if it's not their own
* do you have predictions about what the data will be? No
notices trends, consistencies, theories about the data ("it's easy to hit "like" but it's more work to write a comment")

Notes:
I think we can actually add in the minimizing part of this tutorial, because it doesn't take too long to get through and is a little too easy.
* maybe it is actually good to have both conditions! It's important to get that measure on data relevance between Personal/Impersonal.
* If there's no effect, you'll still be gathering a lot of interest for the tool
* If there's no interest for the tool, you'll maybe be able to tell what's hard about this tutorial by people's notes
* maybe restructure conditions so that both conditions have questions about "intuitions" about the data. Data engagement is a real thing here!
If you use personal data, maybe you can get people to engage in more elements of data science learning, like intuitions, reasoning, theorizing, outlier analysis, trends, verification, etc.
* move the PDF to the interface? * then have automatic plot generated for people to look at and respond about
* S1-3 have been explicitly curious about my coding of the plot

Subj3
"I understood the intercept and the regression and I understood the word parameters and everything because my experience in STATS 311 and INFO 180".
"why is the hypothesis in the middle and not the end?"
*people are pretty willing to give me these numbers, even though I'm sitting right here, oh my god*
No relationship
THAT WAS SO AWESOME, we dug into WHY certain photos got more likes, why there might be no relationship, related it back to house prices, etc.
We dug through the photos and had theories about homecoming, senior photos, etc. Maybe people post "Congratulations!" a lot but the photo doesn't have a lot of people in it because it's as Senior photo.

Subj4
Maybe this tutorial is closer to the sweet spot than I thought, but I need some kind of ACTIVE activity for them to engage in to show that. Andrew Ng has some questions I need to include.
*make it clear that they should include any and all relevant questions, comments, interests, confusions on their participant sheet.
* Was the DATA relevant? (not just the material) maybe ask for both.
* make sure to ask about intuitions before they collect the data/see the data! That's interesting!
* he thought no relationship and he was right
* "I either post things that are really obscure, or something really broad like 'I'm going to college! and that's why I see either nothing or a lot."
"Why couldn't I just use Stats to do this, why do I need a computer?" --> my answer is about having massive amounts of data points, and also about making a "model" prediction

*Participants seem to even care when they see a null relationship lolz

Subj5
MGH noisy and distracting :( then was a little better but not great
FROM PORTLAND OREGON AND SAYS IT WAS COOL! omg, might have to throw her out but she's a great example.
* make it clear that they should write everything down! anything they think of
I feel like I've done this kind of stuff before
"Predicts linear flat relationship (not a lot because I'm using my Facebook)"

Subj6
015 little bit distracting but she says ok
doesn't write too much maybe? or reads through first and then writes
taking a stats course and it's really easy, so not learning much
didn't want to share social media data with researcher because privacy!
* added note on question "experimenter will not look at your posts!"

*have them annotate the actual piece of paper with red pen, not write on their sheet
* that cool theorizing that happens, we should see if we see that about housing data. Because maybe it's not about personal data, but about the prompt of theorizing about the data. Active learning?
Subj7
spent good amount of time annotating and working through the tutorial
"I had taken a stats class before, but it didn't get to linear regression. But now I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what it is."

Subj7
* just have them annotate the tutorial itself
* this weekend, build the dang system
NOTE: do I need a consent form?
NOTE: today, try running the Personal condition?
"It was really easy until the equation and then I got a little lost".
"The more number of likes, the more comments it should get".
wanted to see the code!

Subj8
getting all the way through and "don't have any questions, so that's probably good right?"
"didn't write much down but it all made sense so that's good"
"I'm going to use Instagram because I don't have any Facebook posts, and none of them really have any comments, so let's see. Might be interesting"
"Should I count my own comments?"

Subj9
*most recent 10, not first 10*

Subj10
Didn't look up because it wasn't related to what I was reading
* Maybe I should ask a relationship they WANT to see?
Own data doesn't have people in the images, maybe wants to use friends' data, or different period of time.
* Just first picture for Instagram
"I don't really know of any apps that let me look at my own posts. That's what makes this really interesting for me."
