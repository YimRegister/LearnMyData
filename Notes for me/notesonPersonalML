JANUARY PLAN
(What will serve me best?)

Continue to iterate on prototype: each and every piece must be related to the personalization aspect.
* what do YOU want to learn about, or maybe we even select a tutorial most suited to their data
* predictions and engagement along the way, but in ways that relate to their own data and AI/ML.

Begin to identify the key problems and solutions.
- sparse data (what if they don't have enough data?)
  * negative examples, fill in with other data
- sensitive data (harmful/hurtful posts)
  * feedback mechanisms, maybe some of our own simple exclusion criteria on posts
- interesting data (is it interesting enough?)
  * feedback mechanisms to learn what people care about compared to their whole profiles
