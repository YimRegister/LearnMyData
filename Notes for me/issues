Need to measure prior linear regression knowledge as exclusion criteria
• How’s the data going to get in there? Input in a table. (resolved)
• “Linear Regression” slide: something has to change about the visualization (resolved)
• Add a self-regulation prompt to engage them in the material
• Need to add the posts on hover over the scatter plot
• What kind of hover data would the control condition have, if any? Important question about the intervention.
• “Take some time to hover...” -> give them a task rather than leaving it open ended (resolved)
• “How many Comments will a post get?” Is this a prompt? Be more explicit and be consistent with the bold on the last page. (resolved)
• “You may have heard of...” You need a transition from the last page. “How did you make the prediction? Well here’s how machine learning makes it.”(resolved)
• “Do you think your data could be linear”? Turn this into an actual task where they provide.
• “betwen” (resolved)
• Need to build a dragging behavior.
• Put on GitHub and make an issue tracker
• “The line you chose”... add a prompt?
• “Linear Regression” title is always the same; customize for each page (resolved)
• Give a task on the “vertical lines” page
• Add a back button
• Parameters page: explain why they’re learning, “To really understand how machine learning works, we have to talk about how the line is computed.” (resolved)
• You’ve explicitly chosen m and b; record your design rationale (resolved)
• Animate the m and b in the random line page (resolved)
handle Nans from inputted chart (resolved)

TODO 3/2
- teach about squares of Residuals
- add feedback input
- introduce idea of gradient descent


- action items for research
subject identifier for pre-post tests and way to give those identifiers
consent form?
fix if Nans
remove added_points
